## Credential Manager

Credential Manager is a modern Jetpack library that easily adds common authentication methods to an app, including passwords, passkeys, and federated solutions like Sign In with Google.

The crucial benefit of using Credential Manager is the use of Passkeys. Passkeys allow password-less sign in by using the device's built-in authentication features like PIN or pattern, and biometrics (fingerprint or face).

> At the time of writing, the most common security vulnerability listed in [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/) is 'Improper Credential Usage', so getting authentication right is very important.
